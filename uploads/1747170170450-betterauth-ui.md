TanStack Query
--------------

In order to use `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` with the [`@daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack`](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack) package, all you need to do is change your [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) into an `<AuthUIProviderTanstack>` component. It accepts all of the same props and configuration options.

The main difference is the `persistClient` prop which is only required if you are using a [`persistQueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/plugins/persistQueryClient) for offline Authentication. This prop will tell the authentication methods to use the `/auth/callback` path for all authentication methods that leave the site, which will clear your query cache for you automatically.

Next.js
-------

This guide covers integrating `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` into your Next.js project.

Want to skip the installation? Check out the starter here:

*   App Router: [GitHub](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-nextjs-starter) - [Demo](https://nextjs.better-auth-starter.com/)
    
*   Pages Router: [GitHub](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-nextjs-pages-starter) - [Demo](https://nextjs-pages.better-auth-starter.com/)
    

Follow these steps to set up `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` in your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using the **App Router**:

### [Setting up AuthUIProvider](#setting-up-authuiprovider)

The first step is to set up the [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) client component with your [`authClient`](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#create-client-instance), wrapping your layout. This is required to provide the context & hooks to your authentication components across your application.

app/providers.tsx

**Note**: Since the Next.js **App Router** caches routes by default, navigation to protected routes may fail until you perform a `router.refresh()` to clear the cache. To prevent this issue, you must use `router.refresh()` in the provided `onSessionChange` callback. This forces Next.js to clear the router cache and reload middleware-protected content, ensuring subsequent navigations accurately reflect the current auth state.

Once configured, wrap your layout component with the `Providers` component:

app/layout.tsx

The [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) can be fully customized with plugins, styles, localization and more. For more information and all available props, see the [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) component documentation.

### [Creating Auth Pages](#creating-auth-pages)

Create a dynamic route segment for authentication views in `app/auth/[pathname]/page.tsx`.

app/auth/\[pathname\]/page.tsx

app/auth/\[pathname\]/view.tsx

The newly created dynamic route covers the following paths by default:

*   `/auth/sign-in` – Sign in via email/password and social providers
*   `/auth/sign-up` – New account registration
*   `/auth/magic-link` – Email login without a password
*   `/auth/forgot-password` – Trigger email to reset forgotten password
*   `/auth/two-factor` – Two-factor authentication
*   `/auth/recover-account` – Recover account via backup code
*   `/auth/reset-password` – Set new password after receiving reset link
*   `/auth/sign-out` – Log the user out of the application
*   `/auth/settings` – User account management page (requires authentication)
*   `/auth/callback` – Internal route to handle Auth callbacks

Ensure that any links to the authentication process utilize these routes accordingly. All routes will render the `<AuthCard />` component and automatically handle navigation and authentication flow.

[Pages Router](#pages-router)
-----------------------------

Follow these steps to set up `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` in your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using the **Pages Router**:

### [Setting up AuthUIProvider](#setting-up-authuiprovider-1)

First set up the [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) within your custom App component in `_app.tsx`.

pages/\_app.tsx

Now the authentication context is available across your entire application.

### [Creating Auth Pages](#creating-auth-pages-1)

Create a page with a dynamic segment in your Pages directory in `pages/auth/[pathname].tsx`

pages/auth/\[pathname\].tsx

With this setup, the following routes will automatically handle their associated views:

*   `/auth/sign-in` – Sign in via email/password and social providers
*   `/auth/sign-up` – New user registration
*   `/auth/magic-link` – Magic link email login
*   `/auth/forgot-password` – Initiate forgotten password reset
*   `/auth/reset-password` – Reset password after receiving email
*   `/auth/sign-out` – Log user out of account
*   `/auth/callback` – Internal route to handle OAuth callbacks (do not navigate to this route directly)</content>

TanStack Start
--------------

This guide covers integrating `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` with TanStack Start. We also install [@daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack) to handle the authentication state and queries.

Want to skip the installation? Check out the starter here:

[GitHub](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack-starter) - [Demo](https://tanstack.better-auth-starter.com/)

### [Set up the Auth Provider](#set-up-the-auth-provider)

TanStack Start requires setting up providers slightly differently than a standard React application. Create a root-level provider component:

app/providers.tsx

Note how we use TanStack Router's `useRouter` hook and `Link` component to handle navigation.

### [Configure the Root Route](#configure-the-root-route)

Update your root route to use the Providers component:

app/routes/\_\_root.tsx

TanStack Start uses a file-based routing system. Here's how to set up your authentication routes:

### [Create Auth Route](#create-auth-route)

Create the following route files for authentication:

app/routes/auth/$pathname.tsx

This dynamic route will handle all the authentication paths (sign-in, sign-up, etc.).

This setup provides a solid foundation for integrating Better Auth UI with TanStack Start. You'll get all the benefits of TanStack's powerful routing system along with Better Auth UI's authentication capabilities.</content>

  <content>Integrations

React
-----

This guide covers integrating `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` into your React project.

First, set up [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) as it provides context and hooks required by all subsequent authentication components. Create a top-level provider to encapsulate your app:

src/providers.tsx

Wrap your root component with the newly created Providers component in your main app entry point, typically in `src/main.tsx` or `src/index.tsx`.

src/main.tsx

[Creating Auth Pages](#creating-auth-pages)
-------------------------------------------

Configure routes to render [`<AuthCard>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) for authentication views using React Router.

Create a dynamic authentication route such as `auth/[pathname].tsx` inside your `src` directory. Here's a recommended setup:

src/pages/auth/AuthPage.tsx

Use React Router to configure these dynamic authentication routes:

src/App.tsx

The dynamic segment `[pathname]` covers the following default authentication views:

*   `/auth/sign-in` – Sign in via email, password, social providers, or passkey (WebAuthn)
*   `/auth/sign-up` – New account registration, with additional fields supported
*   `/auth/magic-link` – Email login without password
*   `/auth/forgot-password` – Trigger password reset email
*   `/auth/reset-password` – Allow users to reset forgotten passwords
*   `/auth/sign-out` – Log out action
*   `/auth/settings` – User account management page (authentication required)
*   `/auth/callback` – Internal OAuth/Auth callback handler (do not use directly)

Your authentication flow is now completely set up and supporting full customization capabilities.</content>

<ChangePasswordCard />
----------------------

The `<ChangePasswordCard />` provides a secure and user-friendly interface for users to update their account passwords, seamlessly integrated with your authentication flow. It supports verification workflows to ensure passwords are securely updated, revoking other active sessions when the password changes.

Here's how you can include `<ChangePasswordCard />` in your user account settings page:

This component automatically utilizes the context provided by the [`AuthUIProvider`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) and manages password update workflows seamlessly, including revoking other active sessions upon successful password changes.

  <content>Components

<UpdateAvatarCard />
--------------------

The `<UpdateAvatarCard />` component is a pre-built UI element for users to easily manage and update their avatar image. It seamlessly integrates with the [`AuthUIProvider`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) and utilizes either a custom or built-in avatar upload implementation.

Here's how to include the `<UpdateAvatarCard />` component within your custom settings page. If you don't provide an `uploadAvatar` function, the component will store the avatar image as a base64 string in database.

You can optionally provide `uploadAvatar` prop within your [`AuthUIProvider`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider):

providers.tsx

These are the available props for `<UpdateAvatarCard />`:

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
`className?`

 | 

`string`

 | \- |
| 

`classNames?`

 | 

`SettingsCardClassNames`

 | \- |
| 

`isPending?`

 | 

`boolean`

 | \- |
| 

`localization?`

 | 

`Partial<{ account: string; accounts: string; accountsDescription: string; accountsInstructions: string; addAccount: string; addPasskey: string; alreadyHaveAnAccount: string; avatar: string; avatarDescription: string; ... 131 more ...; passwordTooShort: string; }>`

 | \- |

The `classNames` prop is useful for customizing inner elements using Tailwind classes:

Avatars are auto-cropped, optimized, and resized before uploading:

*   **Cropping**: The image is automatically center-cropped into a square.
*   **Sizing**: Default `avatarSize` is set to:
    *   `128px` (when using built-in storage - base64)
    *   `256px` (when using custom `uploadAvatar`)
*   **File Format**: You can customize the uploaded image file format via `avatarExtension` prop in [`AuthUIProvider`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider). It defaults to `"png"`.</content>

  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/redirect-to-sign-up</url>
  <content>The `<RedirectToSignUp />` component ensures users are redirected to the sign-up page if they are not authenticated. If the user is signed in, it does nothing. It's useful for protected pages in your application, specifically when you want unauthenticated users to immediately register instead of logging in.

[Usage](#usage)
---------------

    import { RedirectToSignUp, SignedIn } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"
     
    export default function ProtectedPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <RedirectToSignUp />
     
          <SignedIn>
            Welcome! You are signed in.
          </SignedIn>
        </div>
      )
    }</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/redirect-to-sign-in</url>
  <content>Components

<RedirectToSignIn />
--------------------

The `<RedirectToSignIn />` component automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. If the user is already authenticated, this component will render nothing and allow the user to view the content normally.

Useful for wrapping pages or routes that require users to be signed in.

Here's a practical example of enforcing authentication for private routes:

PrivateRoute.tsx

In this example, we're ensuring that the user is redirected to the sign-in page if they are not logged in.</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/use-authenticate</url>
  <content>Components

useAuthenticate()
-----------------

The `useAuthenticate()` hook automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. If the user is already authenticated, this hook does nothing and allows the user to view the content normally.

This is a hook alternative to the `<RedirectToSignIn />` component, useful for redirecting users programmatically.

The hook accepts an options object with the following properties:

*   `authView`: The authentication view to redirect to. Can be either "signIn" or "signUp".
*   `enabled`: Whether the authentication check is enabled. When set to `false`, no redirection will occur.

You can conditionally disable the redirection with the `enabled` option:</content>

  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-loading</url>
  <content>Components

<AuthLoading>
-------------

The `<AuthLoading>` component renders its children only during an authentication session loading. This provides an easy way for you to insert loading states or skeleton loaders into your UI, enhancing user experience during data fetching.

Wrap loading placeholders or loader components with `<AuthLoading>` to conditionally render them whenever authentication session data is being fetched.

Here's a complete example of using `<AuthLoading>` with loading skeletons and managing unauthenticated user sessions using the [`<RedirectToSignIn />`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/redirect-to-sign-in) and [`<SignedIn>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/signed-in) components.

ProtectedPage.tsx

### [Explanation](#explanation)

*   `<AuthLoading>` will render the loading skeleton (`<YourCustomSkeleton />`) while authentication or session data is initializing or fetching.
*   `<RedirectToSignIn>` automatically pushes any unauthenticated users to the sign-in page, ensuring pages that require authentication are protected from unauthorized access.
*   `<SignedIn>` ensures the enclosed content (`<DashboardContent />`) only displays for authenticated users.

This combined approach offers seamless handling of loading states, authentication redirection, and conditional rendering based on user authentication state, greatly improving the overall user experience.

* * *

In practice, your skeleton loader will likely be customized. Here's a basic example you can easily customize to fit your use-case:

components/your-custom-skeleton.tsx

This example skeleton provides placeholder components resembling the size and shape of loaded content, greatly reducing UI flicker and enhancing user-perceived loading performance.</content>

  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/signed-out</url>
  <content>Components

<SignedOut>
-----------

The `<SignedOut>` component conditionally renders its children only when the user is not authenticated. It is a simple helper for handling UI components or pages that should only be accessible by guests (unauthenticated users).

Use this component to conditionally hide or show content based on the user's authentication status.

Wrap any content that should be displayed only to signed-out (unauthenticated) users within the `<SignedOut>` component:

</page>

<page>
  <title>Better Auth UI</title>
  <url>https://better-auth-ui.com/components/signed-in</url>
  <content>The `<SignedIn>` component conditionally renders its child components based on whether a user is authenticated.

Use it to display content only visible to logged-in users.

[Usage](#usage)
---------------

Basic usage example:

    import { SignedIn } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"
     
    export default function UserDashboard() {
        return (
            <SignedIn>
                <p>
                    Only signed-in users will see this!
                </p>
            </SignedIn>
        )
    }

[Example](#example)
-------------------

Here's an example demonstrating `<SignedIn>` in a practical scenario:

    import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"
     
    export default function Navbar() {
        return (
            <nav className="h-16 flex justify-between items-center px-4">
                <Link href="/">
                    Home
                </Link>
     
                <SignedIn>
                    <UserButton />
                </SignedIn>
     
                <SignedOut>
                    <Link href="/auth/sign-in">
                        Sign In
                    </Link>
                </SignedOut>
            </nav>
        )
    }

In this example, the [`<UserButton />`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/user-button) component is displayed only if the user has an active session. Otherwise, visitors are prompted with a sign-in link.</content>

  <title>Better Auth UI</title>

  <content><SettingsCards />
-----------------

The `<SettingsCards />` component provides a convenient plug-and-play UI for managing user account settings. It includes a comprehensive suite of manageable account settings, such as changing passwords and email addresses, updating avatars, managing linked providers, handling active sessions, and more.

This component automatically leverages all the features you have enabled via the [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) and provides a seamless user settings UI out of the box.

[Default Settings Page Behavior](#default-settings-page-behavior)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the built-in [`<AuthCard />`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-card) component automatically displays `<SettingsCards />` when the `/auth/settings` route is accessed. If you prefer to handle user settings on a custom route or component, you can override this behavior using the `settingsURL` prop.

To use your own custom settings route and avoid using the default included settings card, you can specify the `settingsURL` prop within your [`<AuthUIProvider>`](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/auth-ui-provider) configuration:

app/providers.tsx

By setting the `settingsURL` as shown above, the built-in `/auth/settings` page will also automatically redirect users to your specified `/dashboard/settings` page.

* * *

[Using `<SettingsCards />` on Your Custom Page](#using-settingscards--on-your-custom-page)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then easily utilize the provided `<SettingsCards />` component directly in your custom settings route within your app's layout. Here's how you might set up a properly protected custom settings route in your framework of choice:

app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx

This will provide users a customizable, fully-styled settings experience without requiring you to create all components yourself.

* * *

You can customize the UI extensively by passing TailwindCSS classes or customizing provided class names through the `classNames` prop.

### [Customizing Styles with classNames](#customizing-styles-with-classnames)

Using Tailwind utility classes, you can fully customize all card states. Here’s an example to illustrate significant styling customization:

### [All available settings included in SettingsCards:](#all-available-settings-included-in-settingscards)

*   **Avatar** (optional, requires avatar upload configured in AuthUIProvider)
*   **Name**
*   **Email**
*   **Username** (requires username plugin)
*   **Password** (optional, requires credentials to be enabled)
*   **Connected Providers** (if enabled)
*   **Active Sessions**
*   **Delete Account** (optional, requires account deletion configuration)

#### [Custom Additional Fields](#custom-additional-fields)

The `<SettingsCards />` also supports displaying any custom `additionalFields` you've provided via the `settingsFields` prop of the `<AuthUIProvider>`:

app/providers.tsx

These fields appear alongside the existing provided setting cards automatically.

Localization
------------

You can fully customize the text strings displayed across all `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` components through the provided `localization` prop. The library ships with a full default localization object [`AuthLocalization`](https://better-auth-ui.com/api-reference/auth-localization), but you can override any of these defaults easily with custom strings.

To modify default strings, you need to provide your custom localization object within your `<AuthUIProvider>` or individual components.

Here's an example of modifying some default strings globally across your application using `<AuthUIProvider>`:

app/providers.tsx

You can also provide overridden strings on an individual component basis. Here's how you can override strings for just one instance, such as the `<AuthCard>`:

You can find all available strings to override in the [`AuthLocalization`](https://better-auth-ui.com/api-reference/auth-localization) reference.</content>

Custom Auth Paths
-----------------

Here's a complete guide on how to customize view paths using the `AuthUIProvider` component. This example will show you how to change the auth routes from `/auth/sign-in` and `/auth/sign-out` to use custom paths such as `/auth/login` and `/auth/logout`, respectively.

### [Step 1: Customize Auth View Paths](#step-1-customize-auth-view-paths)

First, customize the default built-in paths by providing your custom routes through the `viewPaths` prop on the `<AuthUIProvider>` component.

Now your newly configured `viewPaths` object is as follows:

| Default Path | Custom Path |
| --- | --- |
| `/auth/sign-in` | `/auth/login` |
| `/auth/sign-out` | `/auth/logout` |
| `/auth/sign-up` | `/auth/register` |
| `/auth/forgot-password` | `/auth/forgot` |
| `/auth/reset-password` | `/auth/reset` |
| `/auth/magic-link` | `/auth/magic` |
| `/auth/settings` | `/auth/config` |

Next, your authentication page route can dynamically handle these paths. Set up your dynamic authentication page based on these custom routes.

Using Next.js App Router (`app` router):

### [Example usage across your app:](#example-usage-across-your-app)

#### [Linking to new auth views:](#linking-to-new-auth-views)

### [Summary of Steps (Recap):](#summary-of-steps-recap)

*   Defined custom view paths within `AuthUIProvider`.
*   Updated dynamic auth page to handle correct paths within `generateStaticParams`.
*   Revised links/apps accordingly to use your newly specified paths.

You have now successfully customized all your authentication URLs using the shipped customization options while preserving all the other features and integrations seamlessly.</content>

Custom Settings
---------------

The default authentication components provided by `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` include a built-in settings page accessible at `/auth/settings`.

However, for advanced use cases or customization needs, you may want to provide a user settings interface at your own custom path or selectively use only certain settings components within your own application structure.

You have two primary ways to create a custom settings page experience:

1.  Use the built-in plug-and-play `<SettingsCards />` component on your custom route.
2.  Selectively import and use individual components to build your own specific settings page layout.

To override the default built-in settings page URL (`/auth/settings`) with your custom URL (example: `/dashboard/settings`):

### [With AuthUIProvider:](#with-authuiprovider)

Set the `settingsURL` prop within your main application provider:

app/providers.tsx

> **Important**: Once `settingsURL` is set, the built-in `/auth/settings` route will automatically redirect users visiting `/auth/settings` to your custom path, providing a seamless replacement of the default option.

### [Option A: Using `<SettingsCards />`](#option-a-using-settingscards-)

The easiest way is to use the `<SettingsCards />` component, which automatically handles displaying all enabled settings. This includes avatar, email, username, password, linked social providers, session management, delete account, and custom additional fields you've provided.

app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx

You can customize the appearance using TailwindCSS classes through `classNames` props as documented in [SettingsCards](https://better-auth-ui.com/components/settings-cards) documentation:

### [Option B: Individually Using Settings Components](#option-b-individually-using-settings-components)

For finer-grained control, selectively import the components you want:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<UpdateAvatarCard />` | User avatar management |
| `<UpdateNameCard />` | Update user's name |
| `<UpdateUsernameCard />` | Manage username (if applicable/username set via plugin) |
| `<ChangeEmailCard />` | Changing the user's email address |
| `<ChangePasswordCard />` | Allow user to securely update password |
| `<ProvidersCard />` | Linking/Unlinking social provider accounts |
| `<SessionsCard />` | Active session management |
| `<DeleteAccountCard />` | Deleting the user account securely |
| `<UpdateFieldCard />` | Add or update additional custom user fields |

Here's a complete example demonstrating an individually composed user settings page:

app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx

This example assumes `additionalFields` are configured via your `<AuthUIProvider>`:

app/providers.tsx

[Handling Authentication for Settings Page](#handling-authentication-for-settings-page)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's essential that your custom settings page is protected and accessible only by authenticated users. There's a built-in helper `useAuthenticate` to ensure your settings pages are secured:
